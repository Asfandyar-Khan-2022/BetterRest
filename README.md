# BetterRest
This project creates a predition based on variable parameters provided by the user. 
The prediction is the ideal time to go to bed considering the amount of coffee the individual has had.
And the number of hours of sleep they wish for. This project uses IOS build in ML to train a model.

# Code structure
- @State variables are created to store all relevant values
- The content view has a single method which uses the pretrained model to create predictions
- The body is composed of a form with multiple sections
- The first three sections are the variables passed into the model
- The last section provides the prediction for ideal bedtime
